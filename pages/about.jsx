          Theme: Evolution to Eternity
        </div>

        <div className="text-white text-justify w-10/12  sm:w-8/12 mx-auto my-8">
          Not the most intelligent species survive. It is not the fittest that
          survives, but the species that survive are those that adjust and
          acclimate best to a transmuting and challenging environment, Charles
          Darwin said in "The Origin of Species”. All living things are cognate
          through their descendants from a common ancestor. Evolution is “the
          process by which structural rearrangements are affected over time,
          ultimately producing forms or structures that are qualitatively
          different from ancestral forms.” Evolution is not just a biological
          phenomenon; it is a perpetual vicissitude in human life from the
          molecular level to the socio-cultural level. Continued evolution is
          necessary, and more concretely "Evolution: to the Eternity" is the
          only way humanity will survive this expeditious ecumenical change.
          Pantheon'22 aims to celebrate the paramount of evolution in society,
          systems and a common life. The evolution of our psyche is illuminated
          by our individual vigils into the dark background of eternity.
